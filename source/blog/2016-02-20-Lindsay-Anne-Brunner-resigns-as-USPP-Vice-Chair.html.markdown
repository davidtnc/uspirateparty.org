Effective March 1st, 2016, I will be stepping down from all active roles in the United States Pirate Party.

Though it may seem sudden to have both chair and vice-chair resign within a day of each other, I posted my resignation notice on Thursday to my personal social media channels. I have been dreading writing this post.

I have been involved with the Pirate Party for the past 6 years, and every moment of it has been truly unforgettable. I have been so very lucky to have met Pirates from not only across the nation, online and in-person, but Pirates from Germany and Norway. When I first started becoming more active in the USPP, my family and I had the the amazing opportunity to have brunch with Rick Falkvinge and we had a lunch with him, Travis McCrea and other Pirates about a year later.

Many people who I've met through the Pirate Party have become close personal friends as well. Jy, Nick, Brad, Glenn, Lucia, Andrew, Jamie and so many others come to mind when I think of the amazing people I have been able to not only work with, but become friends with too. Guys, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for all that you have done, and those continuing in Pirate Party work, keep it going.

I wrote earlier in the post on Medium that I was leaving to focus on personal projects, the main thing being that now that I very well may finally be cleared to work by my orthopedist after sustaining massive damage to my wrist and arm in an accident that happened four years ago. I've been through four surgeries, countless physical therapy visits, and so much pain. I decided to continue with my work with the United States Pirate Party after the accident, despite everything else going on because I believe in the Pirate values. I was fighting with my first surgeon about my diagnosis and prognosis, the countless physical therapy appointments, second and third and fourth opinion visits, and while I was searching for a surgeon who would be able to fix my wrist and arm without a further loss to a potential career in programming, I managed to serve not one, but two terms as Chair for the National Committee and my current term as Vice-chair, and I am so proud and am highly honored to have been that. Thank you so much for it, it means the world to me.

I finally should be clear to take on the projects I've been putting off since the accident and some newer things I have wanted to do in the past few years. I cannot keep up with the Pirate Party if I focus on these game development projects that I have waited so long to do. I got a taste of doing some of this kind of work this past weekend, and I feel amazing for being able to do it, and I am very sure I want to do this now more than ever. In addition, I should be starting a game development studio later this year, and I hope those of you who enjoy games will be enjoy my work in that field.

That being said, I do not plan on disappearing entirely at all from the Pirate radar. If anything, I still will be around on Twitter and IRC; I'm more than willing to give advice to those coming onboard via email. I plan on coming back, maybe to a less leadership-heavy role, but I need to work on the career that has been denied to me since my accident. I hope you can find this easy to understand. 

I wish you all the best in the coming year ahead and I hold the Pirate Movement so very dear to my heart and I want nothing but the best for it and those people who work so hard to promote it.

Thank you all for everything. I am so very grateful to have been apart of it.

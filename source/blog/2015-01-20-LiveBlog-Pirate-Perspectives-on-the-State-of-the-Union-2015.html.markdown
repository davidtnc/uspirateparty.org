As with 
[last year](https://uspirates.org/state-of-the-union-2014-a-pirate-perspective/), we're going to liveblog the State of the Union address. The State of the Union is often a roadmap for the executive branch, and the President's party, giving indications on policy directions for the coming year.

It's a constitutional requirement of the President, and while some parties feel so self-important about themselves, as to write and give a competing speech, We'd rather just comment on the important one, as clearly and succinctly as possible.

Your hosts are:*Lindsay-Anne "kusanagi" Brunner – Chairperson, US Pirate Party

	
*Andrew "K`Tetch" Norton 
– 
Vice Chair, US Pirate Party / Vice Chair, 
[Pirate Party of Georgia](http://piratepartyofgeorgia.org/)

	
*Nick "itspara" – member, Maryland Pirate Party

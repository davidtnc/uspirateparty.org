The State of the Union address is a required part of our country's government.>He shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.

— Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution

In recent years, it's become less a statement to Congress, and more to the American people. As such it has become customary for opposition parties to give their own version. Rather than doing that, which might be considered usurping a power of the President, we'd rather focus on the content of the President's speech, emphasising what we feel is good, and pointing out what we think is bad.

So, join us at the liveblog below for the Pirate Perspective. Your hosts are

*Lindsay-Anne Brunner - Chairperson, US Pirate Party

	
*Andrew Norton - Vice Chair, US Pirate Party / Vice Chair, Pirate Party of Georgia

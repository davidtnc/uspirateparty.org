As of the meeting of the National Committee on December 4th, 2013, nominations for the Board of the National Committee are now open.

As per our bylaws, anyone involved in a PNC Member-State Pirate Party is eligible for nomination. In the case that there is a nomination of a member who is not in a recognized State Party, one must be involved in Pirate politics.

Rules of nomination are as follows:

To nominate someone else, the nomination must be brought forth by a representative of a PNC Member-State Party. If one is nominated and does not wish to run, no action is required, but it is courtesy to decline the nomination. If one is nominated and does wish to run, one must accept the nomination formally over official USPP communication channels, such as the State Advisory Board mailing list and IRC channels.

To nominate oneself, one must announce the nomination formally over official USPP communication channels, such as the State Advisory Board mailing list and IRC channels. After the self-nomination has been announced, no less than two representatives of PNC Member-State Parties must second the nomination over the aforementioned communication channels.

At this time, 
**no**
 nominations or acceptance thereof will be accepted over social media websites, such as Facebook, Google+, or Twitter.

 

The deadline for nominations is the close of the National Committee meeting on 
**December 12, 2013**
. Any incomplete nomination, such as those that have not been accepted or seconded by the minimum number of representatives, will be deemed abandoned and those nominated will not be eligible to run.

 

Best of luck to all running!

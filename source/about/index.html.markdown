The United States Pirate Party (USPP) was founded in 2006 by Brent Allison and Alex English. Our platform is aligned with the International Pirate Movement. We support and work toward reformation of intellectual property (IP) laws, true governmental transparency, and protection of privacy and civil liberties. We strive for evidence-based policies and egalitarianism, while working against corporate personhood and welfare. We believe that people, not corporations, come first. We would like to encourage you to learn more about our name and values [here].

The Pirate National Committee (PNC), formed in 2012, tracks and assists the growth and development of newly-formed state parties across the nation. As of January 2013, there are 8 member-state parties of the PNC.

The PNC includes delegates from member-state parties across the nation, and is the governing body of the United States Pirate Party. Meetings of the PNC are open to the general public and are held biweekly on Wednesdays at 9PM over IRC.

  <p>Reposted from the 
<a href="https://masspirates.org/">Massachusetts Pirate Party blog</a>.</p>

<p>Today we are joining with Fight for the Future and other groups to protest a judge's order to Apple to build a software "backdoor" to help them hack into the encrypted iPhone of Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters. We will meet at 5:30pm at the Apple Store, 815 Boylston Street in Boston. If you cannot attend the Boston rally, you can find others at 
<a href="https://www.dontbreakourphones.org/">dontbreakourphones.org</a>. Fight for the Future has 
<a href="https://ProtestSign.org">computer/smart phone sign you can get and display</a> and 
<a href="https://www.dontbreakourphones.org/images/flyer.pdf">a flyer you can print out and bring</a>.</p>

<p>The 
<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160220/22154433660/fbi-told-san-bernardino-to-change-password-which-is-why-fbi-now-cant-access-farooks-iphone-data.shtml">FBI botched recovering the data</a> on the phone using existing user recovery methods (and with Apple's help) and 
<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160220/22412933661/no-fbi-does-not-need-info-farooks-iphone-this-is-entirely-about-precedent.shtml">isn't likely to find anything of value on the phone</a>. The FBI says that order is confined to just one phone, but 
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/02/22/fbi-says-apple-court-order-is-narrow-but-other-law-enforcers-hungry-to-exploit-it/">others are eager to exploit a win by the FBI</a>.</p>

<p>Following this order gives the FBI a precedent for getting a backdoor in any phone. Once that precedent is set, it won't be too long before the FBI will be using FISA warrants or potentially no warrants to get into our phones. And if the back door exists, then other countries that don't have our SCOTUS-limited 4th Amendment will be using it to get into the phones of dissidents. Whatever your feelings about Apple, this issue affects all encryption software, and thus potentially everyone's privacy.</p>

<p>If you cannot attend the Boston rally, you can find others at 
<a href="https://www.dontbreakourphones.org/">dontbreakourphones.org</a>. You can even organize one at an Apple store near you, just email 
<a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#064;&#102;&#105;&#103;&#104;&#116;&#102;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#102;&#117;&#116;&#117;&#114;&#101;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#064;&#102;&#105;&#103;&#104;&#116;&#102;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#102;&#117;&#116;&#117;&#114;&#101;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a> so Fight for the Future knows about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.markfiore.com">Mark Fiore</a> has a funny cartoon on being "wiretap friendly" that applies just as well here. Lets make sure we can laugh about this and not fear for our privacy and security.</p>

<p>The FBI got a judge to order Apple to create a custom iOS version so they can decrypt the work iPhone 5c of Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters. They want Apple to push out a custom version that will disable the delays between wrong pin entries and the ten wrong pin tries and the phone gets wiped security feature. Apple is fighting it.</p>

<p>Considering that ISIS didn't know about the attack, it is doubtful there is much on the phone that will help them get other leads. The FBI can already request the metadata (who was called, when, how long, from where) for Farook's communications using the phone or any other service the shooters used. The mobile phone providers are always willing to provide that information, often for a fee. Whatever other info they need, the NSA has likely gathered it with their mass surveillance program. FBI could use the NSA's data to identify what other information they need and then get a subpoena to get the data legally, though unconstitutionally.</p>

<p>It isn't as if the Federal government hasn't used

<p>The phone was owned by Farook's employer, the San Bernardino Health Department, and

Had they not, the FBI could have backed up the data to Apple's iCloud service and gained access to it. It isn't clear who made the decision to reset the password.</p>

<p>Which is all good for the FBI, because it gives them the excuse they need to force Apple to modify iOS to make it easier to break into, and set a precedent for getting a backdoor in any phone,

Once those backdoors are there, anyone can take advantage of them whether the security services of other countries, criminals or abusive ex-boyfriends. 
<a href="http://qz.com/332059/apple-is-reportedly-giving-the-chinese-government-access-to-its-devices-for-a-security-assessment/">That process may already have begun with China.</a></p>

<p>I’ll come as no surprise to many that today I’m announcing my resignation from the USPP, effective March 1 2016. I’ve been with it I’ve been with the USPP off and on since July 2006, and in the last 9.5 years, I’ve learnt a lot, experienced more, and made a lot of friends, and professional contacts. I also learnt some languages, helped coordinate some campaigns, co-edited and published a book, and spent a bunch of time looking really uncomfortable on TV cameras (be it G4TV’s Attack of the Show on "
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYWdPU4Ti9M">Porn Piracy</a>", or Al Jazeera America’s The Stream on 
<a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/the-stream/the-latest/2013/11/12/hacktivism.html">the sentencing of a computer hacker</a>).</p>

<p>However, much as I was in the summer of 2009, I’m just about out of steam on the Pirate front at present. One of my biggest problems is that I’ve allowed myself to be drawn into too many different (albeit complimentary) directions, and thus spread myself too thin. I have a whole host of projects either part started, or waiting for me to start. It’s come to the point where I have so many commitments that I can’t do any of them to a level that satisfies me. So in order to do that, I need to reduce some of my commitments, and the Pirate Party is one of them.
<!--more--></p>

<p>It’s not that I don’t feel the Pirate Party (or indeed the Pirate movement as a whole) is important, it’s that in order to dedicate the time to it I feel it needs, I would not have sufficient time to clear any of my other projects.</p>

<p>Those that know me, know I’m my own worst critic. I’m also fiercly proud of my personal integrity, and –  much as it pains me to admit it – it’s been pretty clear that this last year or so under my leadership has been less than effective. In my candidacy I promised at least incidence of national media coverage and I was unable to deliver. That was a significant failure on my part, and I willingly accept responsibility for that.</p>

<p>In addition, I have been significantly deficient in attempts to recruit and encourage new membership and to help new parties start. It was not deliberate, and I can only reiterate that my failings are due to taking on far too much for my ability, leaving me unable to do anything effectively.</p>

<p>For my hubris I strongly apologize.</p>

<p>In actuality, the Pirate National Committee is due for replacements (due back in December actually) and so it’s actually past time for some fresh blood at the helm. Thus, as with 
<a href="https://medium.com/@liz_kusanagi/recovering-and-the-future-f5c0fff8fd23#.hap4kwpdz">Liz's announcement a few days ago</a>, I’ll be stepping back entirely.</p>

<p>I will not be vanishing entirely though. I will still be researching and writing on pirate topics, plus one of the projects I hope to have finished is a history of the first ten years of the Pirate Party movement, worldwide. In addition, I hope to finally be able to finish the second edition of No Safe Harbor, and get out its sequel, which is a number of years delayed at present.</p>

<p>And as to the inevitable question “Will I be back (again)”, that’s a question for the future, and certainly not one I can answer at present.</p>

<p>It’s been a long strange road at times the last ten years, but it’s not one I would trade for anything.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>I recently got a letter from Myron Goretzky at the ‘Coalition for National Referendum’ (CNR), trying to convince me that the Pirate Party should support Donald Trump for President.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*I-vCmBb19GnggIC040Fi1w.png" /></p>

<p>In case you hadn’t noticed, the 
<a href="https://uspirates.org/">US Pirate Party</a> (I’m assuming he means the US Pirate Party anyway, doubt a 
<a href="https://pirateparty.org.uk/">Pirate Party UK</a> endorsement would get me fame and fortune — Note to Myron: Be More Specific in your sales pitch) hasn’t endorsed anyone, and there’s some history to that, so let me start by explaining that.
<!--more--></p>

<p>In January 2008 under my leadership, the US Pirate Party (USPP) 
<a href="https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-party-endorses-obama-080103/">endorsed President Obama’s candidacy</a>. In discussions with his campaign, we were promised transparency, forward thinking evidence based agendas and issues. Six months later, we had to withdraw that endorsement. The reason was the FISA Amendments Act. Among other things, this gave retroactive immunity from prosecution for telecom companies that had participated in illegal and unconstitutional surveillance on the American people with the Bush National Security entities. This is a bad thing, as it gave companies a pass on violating the rights of the citizens just because the government asked nicely. 
<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/110-2008/s168">Obama voted Yea</a>, while Clinton voted No, and McCain didn’t vote. Under Obama we’ve had the 
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/obama-on-mass-government-surveillance-then-and-now/">expansion of surveillance</a>, and the 
<a href="http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/10/jake-tapper/cnns-tapper-obama-has-used-espionage-act-more-all-/">heavy prosecution of whistleblowers</a> attempting to bring any sort of accountability to the Government — one of our key points — while attempting to 
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/06/obama-verizon-surveillance-erosion-liberties">undermine privacy</a> — the second of our key points.</p>

<p>So now, it’s extremely unlikely that the US Pirate Party would endorse anyone as a whole; once bitten twice shy as the saying goes. Now it may be up to the state parties to decide for themselves if they want to endorse, but the national group, nope.</p>

<p>However, to the letter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Only under the most suspicious of circumstances will Donald Trump not be the Nominee of the Republican Party“ To restore Democracy under those circumstances we believe that Donald Trump should be, in conjunction with other Political Parties, the Presidential Nominee of the Pirate Party.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Suspicious? Hardly. While he may be a loud and rambunctious orator with a significantly outspoken support base, his support base is numerically not as large as its media impact would assume. Additionally, his 
<a href="http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/">bombastic rhetoric of falsehoods</a> and insubstantial policy boasts (which mostly resort to ‘
here’s an idea, I’ll think up some details later’ pronouncements) are matched only by his demagoguery-laden rants which may well appeal to emotions (hatred is an emotion) and stoke fear amongst those whose knuckles have carpet-burns, that their easy ride in life might be made harder by having to compete with better people.</p>

<p>Many people actually understand that if the Republican Primary were actually an series of The Apprentice, Mr Trump would be fired on week one because while he might have a decent sales attitude, his sales pitch is for a product he doesn’t have and could never deliver, all while his business plan is non-existent. Nor could he fall back on his wealth as a sign he knows what he’s doing, not when ‘letting someone else handle it’ would have resulted in perhaps three times as much, so he’s not exactly a great businessman either.</p>

<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="600"]
<img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*tp8fUx9Kc1aBYCWpLBlH7A.jpeg" /> One of these is a spoilt rich kid whose parents didn't love them enough to tell them ‘no’. Oooh, wait, that’s both of them…[/caption]</p>

<p>Then there’s his mannerisms. He’s basically bullied his way through things, and that’s incredibly polarizing. It appeals to bullies, but alienates those who think the position of President should be filled by someone who isn’t a “moron with a Megaphone”, and a cowardly one at that. His<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/26/here-are-the-megyn-kelly-questions-that-donald-trump-is-still-sore-about/">petulant spat with Megyn Kelly</a>over what were basic and obvious questions highlight his very unsuitability for office and his tantrums since, including his refusal to participate in a debate in case he should have to — god forbid — answer some more softball questions from her (it’s not like she’s asking complex policy questions) speaks incredibly poorly to his mental state and ability to deal with the most basic rigours of ANY public office.</p>

<p>So no, it’s not ‘the most suspicious of circumstances’, it’s actually more ‘the most probable of circumstances’. To paraphrase Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back, “
He’s a one-note joke that only cowards cheer for, spouting catchphrases like a 3rd rate Ted Nugent or Rush Limbaugh. He’s Clown Shoes.”</p>

<p>What reason could we possible have to endorse this pathetic egesta of a candidate?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This would enable the Pirate Party, in conjunction with other Political Parties, to receive the National coverage and fundraising comparable to the Democratic and Republican Parties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, so principles have nothing to do with why we should endorse him. We should endorse him not because his views align, but because that way we can get 
<strong>MONEY</strong>
 and 
<strong>PUBLICITY</strong>
.</p>

<p>Is there anything sadder and more pathetic in this world than the wretched dregs of humanity who will say and do anything in order to get publicity or money? Prostituting one’s principles, integrity and self-respect because someone flashed some cash and a camera your way.</p>

<p>Frankly, I don’t know what’s worse, that there are probably those that would sell themselves for a mess of pottage, or that he thinks I’m one of them.</p>

<p>On the lighter side, anyone that did take up this foolish offer may wish they’d held out for more, as any coverage from the endorsement is likely to be minimal, and there’s liable to be no money magically winging its way to them. It’s not how it works.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We would like to list your name Website and/or email address on our Website, 
<a href="http://www.nationalreferendum.org/">www.nationalreferendum.org</a>, in support of the following:"Should Donald Trump NOT be the Nominee of the Republican Party then we support Donald Trump being the Presidential Nominee of the Pirate Party in conjunction with other Political Parties,"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought it was only ‘under the most suspicious of circumstances’ that he wouldn’t get the nod. So why do you want us to say anything? Could it be you’re hoping that if you get ‘
someone’ you’ll get some of the attention you promise others?</p>

<p>Whichever way you try and spin it, it’s a pathetic attempt to try and drum up support for what is possibly one of THE most ridiculous and farcical candidatures in American politics (and that’s saying a lot).</p>

<p>Perhaps the ‘CNR’ would be better named “Can Not Read” because if they’d read anything about the Pirate Party, they’d know we’re not even in the same ballpark.</p>

<p>I will say this though Myron, you provided us with one hell of a laugh. The only thing the mollified us in that was that the fear that you’re serious in your support, and not just out for another cheap publicity stunt like your 
<a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19751016&amp;id=TpJKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gpQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3510,3137496&amp;hl=en">1976 Presidential campaign.</a></p>

<p>As it stands, I’m afraid it’s a ‘No’ to the fabulous fame and wonderful wealth you promise. Integrity means too much to me, and there’s one particular phrase that sums up why to me:</p>

<p><strong>“If you could be bought, you wouldn’t be worth the price they paid”</strong></p>

<p>A person, group or organization who readily sells out their core beliefs, has no worth at all, and I do not consider myself worthless. Perhaps your email will land in the inbox of some worthless unprincipled soul, where you can pimp Verruca Salt’s candidacy to them. All I can say is that I pity them, for having fallen so hard to be so desperate. We, however, are not so desperate.</p>

  <h2><a href="blog/US-Pirate-Party-Lessig-and-the-State-of-US-Democracy/">US Pirate Party, Lessig, and the State of US Democracy</a> <span>Nov  2</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>What follows is a statement from the US Pirate Party's leadership on the decision by Professor Lawrence Lessig to withdraw his candidacy.</p>

<p>The US Pirate Party expresses our disappointment with the decision by the Democratic National Committee to change the rules of their debate admittance to avoid having to face tough questions about the decrepit state of the ‘Democracy’ in the United States.</p>

<p>Much claim has been made around the world about the US and its democracy, but in recent years, it has been shown as a lie, as open and honest democracy has been perverted by hidden money, slanderous attacks, and lashing out at the media when it attempts to do its job of bringing some clarity and factual awareness. Professor Lessig has campaigned on the fact that this institutionalized corruption of the US election system was not in any way democratic, and has become a bigger threat to the US than any terrorist group, drug trafficking or religious extremism ever could be. Rather than allow Prof. Lessig's message be heard, the Democratic National Committee has shown that this is a problem that the Democrats are as keen to keep as is, like the Republicans are.</p>

<p>The US Pirate Party would love to be able to offer ballot space to Professor Lessig to run as a Pirate candidate, but currently, we unable to do that either. We are unable to do that because the means for getting party registration and ballot access (as well as keeping it) is deliberately made as difficult as possible. We have 50 sets of rules to follow, one for each of the 50 different states, for ballot access, and most are deliberately made difficult to fulfill. In most states, if you then don’t reach some arbitrary goal, be it signatures numbering in the thousands, expenditure limits, or votes won, your party is de-registered and you have to undergo the entire process again. It’s not that a democracy can’t handle multiple parties; in fact, democracy flourishes in direct proportion to the number of parties. It just makes it easier for those in charge of ballot access – usually a partisan elected position such as Secretary of State or Lt. Governor – to restrict the number of parties to reduce any potential threat to their own political well-being.</p>

<p>That’s not democracy, that’s outright 
<strong>anti-democratic</strong>, the very antithesis of what democratic discourse 
should be.</p>

<p>It has been a little over 9 years since the US Pirate Party was initially formed, and in that time we have only managed to gain recognition in a handful of states. Elsewhere around the world, no Pirate Party has had the levels of difficulty as we in the US have in getting and staying registered as a political party, be in it Russia, South America, or Africa. At the end of the day, it seriously brings into question any idea of the US having a democratically elected government; when partisan officials place such roadblocks against political participation to protect their own job security, that is the hallmark of a banana republic. That is what the US is steadily becoming.</p>

<p>We will not stand to let the corrupt career politicians have their way, lining their pockets with ill-gotten gains from lobbyists and corporations that look to infringe on our rights as Americans and humans. We will fight, no matter what it takes, to bring and maintain a true democracy in the United States.</p>

  <p>Two weeks ago, the House Agriculture Committee<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150527/09320831127/even-before-tpp-ttip-us-already-being-forced-to-change-laws-trade-agreements.shtml">voted 38-6</a>to repeal country-of-origin-labeling. (COOL), and now it's the full House's turn. In a<a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll333.xml">300-131 vote</a>yesterday the "country of Origin Labeling Amendments Act" (<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr2393/text">HR 2393</a>) passed with the support of a significant number of Democrats as well as the majority of Republicans.</p>

<p>The bill's prompting and passage came after the World Trade Organisation ruled in favor of Canadian farmers, who sued claiming it was "discriminatory" and thus in violation of Free Trade Agreements. The problem? Cattle bought from abroad would have to be segregated from domestic cattle, increasing costs and making imports less desirable.</p>

<p>With Fast Track coming up for a vote – perhaps even today – it's curious to see<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/house-votes-repeal-country-origin-labeling-meat-31684167">this snippet in the Associated Press report</a>on the vote by the Speaker of the House:<!--more--></p>

<p>That is, of course, the same John Boehner that has been encouraging the President to get more support for Fast Track, in order to pass more of these "Free Trade" deals that impose more international bureaucrats and will almost certainly lead to more disputes that "require" Congress to "not sit idly by."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, remember<a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/05/read_obamas_speech_at_nike_ful.html">what President Obama said</a>at the Nike Plant just a few weeks ago:</p>

<p>Less than one month on, and we have exactly what he claimed 'is not true' happening. A trade agreement forcing a law change, and having what some would claim is an impact on food safety. And it's happening a day or so before the House is voting to create even more such situations whilethat it won't do this. Do they not even recognize what it is they're voting on?</p>

So now, I’ll hopefully give us a plan to work forward from here, and leave us, at the end of the year, better, stronger and more productive than before.</p>

<p>In my candidacy, I made a few promises</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to start us growing again, we have kind of stagnated over the last 2 years, we need to focus more on issues, and getting support, rather than apathy and needless bureaucracy. One of the first things I'd do is finally upgrade the terrible IT infrastructure we have, with help from the PPUK IT team, and migrate to their 'NewWebPlatform'. I also want to start hammering on key issues, like accountability (especially of the police) surveillance laws, and (a topic very close to my heart, since it came from my work) the Net Neutrality fight, and I also aim for at least 1, preferably two, national TV appearances in the next year</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This should not be too hard for us, if it is, then we should just give up now.</p>

<p>I want to reiterate as well what I consider to be the 3 planks of the Pirate Platform</p>

<p>*Government Accountability and Transparency</p>

<p>*Increased Personal Privacy</p>

<p>*Copyright, Patent and Trademark reform.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Perhaps one of the hardest things for us to do is to register at the state level. It’s one of the foibles of the US that unlike just about every other western country, there’s no such thing as a National political party. Instead every state, territory, and Federal District has their own separate set of rules, regulations and requirements for a party. What’s more, in many states there’s two sets of rules, one for the two ‘major parties’, and another for everyone else, with the overall aim that smaller parties have greater obstacles to overcome just to stay on the ballot, because of their lack of incumbency. It fosters the very two-party two-step that has consigned American politics to the gutter it currently languishes in. When you combine that with the fundamentally corrupt practice of gerrymandering, and the disgusting and shameful attempts at voter-suppression through so-called ‘Voter ID laws’ and opposition to independent monitoring; it turns a country that styles itself as “land of the free” and presided over by the “Leader of the Free World” into an election system that a banana republic would look down on.</p>

<p>Yet it’s not only the elected officials that need to face both accountability and transparency, but appointed officials as well. Officials of the government; be they police officers, intelligence “agents”, or members of state agencies, need to follow the law, and be held accountable to the law. If anything, those tasked to uphold the law should be held to a higher standard, with little tolerance for excuses about how ‘difficult’ it will make their job, or that it’ll take more time – if they don’t care to adhere to the laws, they have no business enforcing them.</p>

<p>It is also time that we, as a Nation, grew up, and stopped reacting in panic and fear whenever anything vaguely unsettling happens. It seems that all someone has to do is invoke one of the 4 Horsemen of the Information Apocalypse (terrorists, drug dealers, kidnappers, and child pornographers) and any/all principles go out the window. There is no Digital Boogieman out there, and in throwing the rules out of the window any time someone utters an excuse for unethical or otherwise illegal behavior by quoting one of those reasons, a piece of liberty, of our very freedom dies.</p>

<p>There is also no evidence that the nebulous threat of ‘Terrorism’ has been reduced in any way, despite the massive erosion of our privacy rights. There is a saying that insanity is “doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” For all the intrusions on our privacy, the only terrorist threats that the US Government has been able to stop, are threats they themselves created and nurtured. Of the actual actions (dud or not), the privacy-destroying actions made no difference. So to expect things to improve by just a little less privacy is taking that saying literally, and naught but the sheerest nonsense.</p>

<p>Now if the citizens of this great nation are not permitted their privacy, the opposite seems to be true for the government. Freedom of information requests are stymied frequently, with the FBI seeking to intervene in requests involving a controversial device known as a Stingray. Challenges to potentially illegal surveillance methods are kept from the oversight role traditionally held by the Judicial branch by claims of State Secretes privilege in order to destroy any chance of proving standing. All this while the Senate intelligence oversight committee’s work was interfered in, by the very agency it is supposed to regulate.</p>

<p>This brings me to the torture report. Some have claimed that it would do nothing but ‘embolden America’s enemies’, but that’s nonsense. What emboldened them was not the torture report – it’s a pile of paper full of words – but the acts of torture themselves. What the report may do is continue to increase anti-US sentiment, but only if the war crimes – and let’s not beat about the Bush here, they are war crimes and ones the US has long been happy to prosecute – are left unaddressed and the guilty parties protected. To date only one person has gone to jail in relation to the torture at Guantanamo Bay, and that man, John Kiriakou, was arrested, convicted and jailed not for his part in the torturing, but for talking to a journalist about the torture.</p>

<p>Kiriakou is just one of many Americans who have attempted to speak out against government policies that are becoming ever-more divergent from democratic ideals and the unspoken will of the populace. Chelsea Manning, Thomas Drake, Jeffery Stirling, Edward Snowdon; people who have been persecuted and prosecuted not for harming the country, but for harming those that have harmed the country, investigated for revealing the pointless, useless, immoral or illegal acts undertaken in the name of the US, hounded for being a patriotic American and exposing those that prostitute themselves and our nation for their own self-worth.</p>

<p>And yes, I call them Patriots, because Patriots they are. Patriotism is not slavish unheeding devotion and adulation to a country, or focusing so intently on waving the flag and singing the national anthem (or chanting the pledge of allegiance if you prefer) that you render yourself unable to see or hear the misdeeds done in your countries name. Having the pack-minded mentality of a drooling idiot is not good for any country, and by trying to term it ‘patriotism’ a great disservice is done. As has long been quoted “When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.” Under the auspices of sham-patriotism you can commit some egregious acts. Terrible atrocities excused with the claim of “for the greater good”, be it slavery, genocide, or the Japanese internment camps of World War 2.</p>

<p>Now we have a whole new breed of excuses for bad behavior, in the form of police officer activity justifications. While the law enforcement profession does involve contact with criminals, the majority of people they interact with are not. Presumption of innocence is the core tenet of our justice system, and its one that has to be applied at all levels, including by the police. And with the power we imbue law enforcement there needs to come some responsibility as well. That means no more excuses about “split-second decisions” – we all have to make those and live with the consequences. Besides, isn’t that the point of training after all, to ensure that when it comes to split-second decisions the right one is made? Such excuses say one thing to me, and that is the person involved was not adequately trained, and should therefore not have put themselves in that situation. What’s more, if law enforcement officers are afraid of having to justify their actions in an honest and open courtroom, an activity they have no qualms about inflicting on others, then they have no business being in law enforcement. You don’t get to dish it out if you can’t take it.</p>

<p>Not that they’re alone in acting like cowardly hypocrites. Government at all levels is populated with people that claim one thing, but do another, and forget what their job is there to do. It’s not there to represent your pet fringe element, or to try and introduce your own version of Sharia law – Being vociferously opposed to laws based on Islam, but not if you use it to then springboard into essentially the same thing based on Islam’s Abrahamic sibling; Christianity. Religion belongs to you alone, not in public policy, not in laws, and not in exemptions from laws.</p>

<p>Beliefs are more harmful than just ‘small government pro-life’ liars trying to expand government overreach into peoples bodies, while trying to justify killing people and considering huge sections of our population as unworthy of equal protection under the law as provided by the 14th amendment. The national economic policy is currently based on beliefs that have been shown to be utterly false. Not only has ‘trickle-down’ been an abject failure, but the “low taxes spurs economic growth” myth has been completely and utterly busted countless times, with Kansas having to make extensive cuts to essential services to pay for handouts to businesses. Over and over it’s been proven that Reaganomics don’t work, but the beliefs persist and are destroying the infrastructure of this country.</p>

<p>Even if we were to fix this issue, there are other long term problems that may quite literally kill America. Manmade climate change is a reality, not a question, a doubt, a controversy, or even contentious. There is consensus, and instead of actually fighting with facts and intellectual honesty, many in Congress are busy lying to themselves and to their constituents to appease those that finance their campaigns. Often their arguments are akin to claiming gravity is nonsense, because of paper airplanes. Likewise our healthcare system is still an issue. While the Affordable Healthcare Act was a step forward, it was only a small step, and didn’t address the big problems of “healthcare by insurance bureaucrat”. It also doesn’t help that so many of our politicians are busy working for their lobbyist masters, trying to undo what little reforms we have had, on the basis of lies.</p>

<p>Or take the keystone XL Pipeline. Rather than letting agencies do what they are there to do, like make sure it’s not going to kill a lot of Americans, they believe they know better. Clearly oil industry campaign donations are worth more than expert opinions. Then again, we’re often talking about those that proclaim to be ‘pro-life’ to the point of mandating severe government intrusion into a doctor-patient consultation; but are happy for those fetuses and their mothers to die from contaminated drinking water to appease their masters.</p>

<p>But even if the science and facts conclude that the pipeline is too dangerous, and Congress decides to acquiesce to reality, it’s not over. The Canadian Prime Minister has indicated that the US might face claims under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), for essentially intruding on the profits of Canadian companies. Just think about that for a second. The will of the US Government can be second-guessed by a commercial arbiter if that democratic will infringes on the profitability of a company. It’s already happened elsewhere – Australia with its plain packaging tobacco laws, and Canada because they wouldn’t grant a patent for an ineffective pharmaceutical product.</p>

<p>And this is only the tip of the iceberg; more treaties, with more countries are on the way. One of the most mis-contextualised and misquoted statements in modern times is then-Speaker Pelosi’s “pass it to see what’s in it” comment on the ACA from 2010. The actual quote was actually quite different in context, and yet these treaties are exactly what that quote was made out to be. We had the text of the ACA, but we don’t have the text of these new treaties, it’s considered a secret, literally classified. The only ones who do have access to the text are lobbyists for the very industries that may then turn it against this nation. We have to rely on leaks, on Wikileaks, to tell us what’s in a treaty that would supersede federal law. And why is this? It’s because if people knew what was in them, they’d be against it and they’d never pass. To reduce that risk, the President has has asked for “fast track authority” - essentially blindly approve these treaties ‘on trust’ without any of those pesky Constitutional Safeguards.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t believe that any treaty negotiated in such bad faith, on behalf of the American people, is one that should ever be signed.</p>

<p>That presents us with a problem though, and that problem is Congress. You wouldn’t trust them to walk your dog, but somehow do trust them to write this nation’s laws. They are almost universally despised, and yet they keep being re-elected. If we want to bring this country out of its death spiral of domestic abuse, then we as a nation need to divorce ourselves from these figurative abusive spouses. That won’t happen while they continue to rig the political situation to their favor. We need significant ballot access reform, to allow competent candidates without massive financial backing and insider knowledge to have the chance to run for office without being drowned in red tape. Currently every single state has their own set of ballot access laws, and many are set up to significantly benefit the two big parties. What we end up with are incumbents who face no challenge because of the extreme difficulty for an opponent to get on the ballot.</p>

<p>And while it’s hard to get on the ballot, in many cases the districts represented are designed to pre-determine an outcome by creating safe seats in a process known as Gerrymandering. In most states it’s done by the state government, meaning if one party is in control of that state’s legislature, they can ensure that that state’s Congressional representatives favor their party for the next decade. That’s not democracy. Even non-partisan commissions are not the solution, although they are enough of a threat to the political overlords that in at least one state they’re being active fought. Instead we need to a move to a completely independent system without personal bias, such as shortest splitline districting.</p>

<p>Finally, the most egregious campaigning abuses in recent times has been the corrupting influences of campaign contributions. No longer are legislators beholden to their electorate, but instead they are in the pockets of special interests. They focus on fundraising rather than deal with the concerns of their constituents. Above all else, they’re often afraid to take on lobby groups for fear of alienating campaign contributions, or being targeted by dark-money attack adverts. In a post-Citizens United America, democracy has been put up for sale to the highest bidder. And that is why we much bring about comprehensive campaign finance reform. It is time elected officials remembered that they are there to undertake the will of the people, and it is they that are their paymasters, not lobbyists or those that would buy influence.</p>

<p>It is time that the country that styles itself as the Greatest Democracy on Earth once again becomes a Government of the People, by the People, and for the People.</p>

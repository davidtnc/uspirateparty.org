  <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThe United States Pirate Party is overjoyed that both Net Neutrality and Community Broadband measures passed the FCC today.</p>

<p>The Net Neutrality proposal comes from almost 8 years of wrangling with the FCC, starting from research in 2007 that showed Comcast to be interfering with people attempting to use the BitTorrent protocol, regardless of content. This research, conducted by US Pirate Party Chairman Andrew Norton 
<a href="http://torrentfreak.com/comcast-throttles-bittorrent-traffic-seeding-impossible/">for the news site TorrentFreak</a> was later verified by both the Associated Press, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>

<p>"
These provisions make for a stronger step forward for citizens of the US," states Norton. "
Despite the plethora of lies and misrepresentations by the major players in the Internet Service Provider (ISP) industry, the FCC has today ruled to take away their ability to fleece consumers and line their pockets at the public trough without consequence."</p>

<p>The votes strengthen not just protections for consumers, but their ability to build their own community networks where they feel unserved, an activity pre-emptively banned by state laws, prompted by anti-competitive suggestions by incumbent ISPs.</p>

<p>"
With these two votes, the FCC has ensured that monopoly ISPs will not stifle competition or prevent small businesses and new startups from accessing the Internet on the same terms as the previously-established companies," stated Vice-Chair Lindsay-Anne Brunner.</p>

  <p>As with 
<a href="https://uspirates.org/state-of-the-union-2014-a-pirate-perspective/">last year</a>, we're going to liveblog the State of the Union address. The State of the Union is often a roadmap for the executive branch, and the President's party, giving indications on policy directions for the coming year.</p>

<p>It's a constitutional requirement of the President, and while some parties feel so self-important about themselves, as to write and give a competing speech, We'd rather just comment on the important one, as clearly and succinctly as possible.</p>

  <p>The horrific shootings yesterday in Paris, France at the office of a satirical paper have shocked the world. To the people of France, our colleagues Parti Pirat du France, and the families and friends of those wounded and killed, the United States Pirate Party sends our deepest condolences.</p>

<p>In the United States, soon after the news of the tragic killings broke, many elected officials spoke about the attacks. One of these officials, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) took the time to condemn the attacks, but also state that the reforms desperately needed to the 
<a href="http://www.allgov.com/news/top-stories/nsa-waits-until-christmas-eve-to-release-documents-admitting-illegal-spying-141229?news=855219">NSA's admitted illegal spying</a> are 
<a href="https://twitter.com/GrahamBlog/status/552848190773686273">"eroding"</a> any way to prevent such an attack. The Senator from South Cowardina hasn't yet noticed that despite all the reforms that have been made to rein in our far-overreaching intelligence programs have been extremely minor, despite Graham implying otherwise. In fact, the bill to reform the bulk metadata collection program of the NSA was just two votes shy of breaking the Republican-led filibuster that stopped the bill in its tracks.</p>

<p>For certain, the Pirates would love to know what "common sense" Graham used to tell journalists to "be concerned" when speaking on CNN yesterday. Should they be concerned that Graham and other chickenhawks will try to erode freedom further by expanding the NSA's already admitted illegal actions?</p>

<p>Stating that "even though it’s in France, it’s an attack on us" doesn't send a message of solidarity at all, but of self-centeredness and egotism that has pushed America into conflicts that we do not belong in, using tactics that have not been proven at any point to stop these sorts of attacks, including interrogation, torture, and the mass collection of metadata.</p>

<p>To continue to allow the NSA to run unchecked is to cower in fear of those who would do us harm. As Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier, who died in yesterday's attack, said he would "rather die on my feet than live on my knees" in fear of retaliation for his work, we Pirates must stand and fight against any sort of lax rules regarding the NSA's spying and further infringement upon our freedoms, including freedom of the press and freedom of speech. Instead of allowing our Government to take more of our rights away, we must fight onward and not fear whatever may come from us using our voices and votes to fight for a world we want to live in.</p>

<img alt="Image CC-BY-SA Pirate Times" src="http://piratetimes.net/wp-uploads/news/2014/12/kdc-636x310.jpg" /> Image CC-BY-SA Pirate Times[/caption]The announcement of launching a US arm to ‘the Internet Party’ (by Mega founder Kim Dotcom) seems, on its face, quite good news. A rich, media-savvy person who understands technology getting into the US political scene to stir things up and fight for digital rights, and freedoms; sounds great, right?
<!--more--></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>There’s one big problem with Kim Dotcom’s new plan, and that’s Kim Dotcom. It’s the same problem that the Internet Party in New Zealand has.</p>

<p>To explain the big problem, you have to look at what the party does and says. Sure it says it’s for improved internet access, restricting government surveillance, and copyright reform, but that’s all it’s done, ‘said’ it. There are no actions, just some extravagant media events (often planned and advertised without even 
<a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11187592">checking on the law</a>). These events result in very little. That’s because the main focus of the party is not these topics. The focus of the party – its entire existence in fact – is to promote Kim Dotcom and to put political pressure on issues and people directly affecting him and his legal woes.</p>

<p>The agenda could already be inferred from his statements at launch, where he talks about being ‘Hillary’s worst nightmare, in the same breath as claiming to be a ‘Digital Freedom Fighter’.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/539567677732171777"><img alt="Tweet from Dotcom I am not a pirate, I am not a fugitive, I am not a flight risk, I'm your Internet Freedom Fighter, AND Hillary's worst nightmare in 2016 " src="http://piratetimes.net/wp-uploads/news/2014/12/kdctweet-300x234.png" /></a></p>

<p>However, it can also be observed from his previous antics in New Zealand, such as the mid-September
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/julian-assange-and-edward-snowden-join-piracy-mogul-kim-dotcoms-political-campaign-in-new-zealand-9734484.html">event</a> Dotcom hosted, with guest appearances from Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald and Julian Assange. While that event was nominally about New Zealand’s participation in an international coalition of spying, it eventually denigrated into another 
<a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11324988">attack</a>by Dotcom on New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, who Dotcom sees as an instrumental figure in his own personal legal battles.</p>

<p>It’s also ironic to include Assange, who in many ways is similar to Dotcom, in that he also started a political party. The ‘Wikileaks Party’, ostensibly on digital rights and accountability. This political party also became somewhat of a cult of personality, as has the larger Wikileaks organization. This resulted in that many strong supporters have left, or disassociated themselves with the group following Assange’s activities in recent years. These actions underscore Assange’s belief that he IS Wikileaks, and that the whistleblowing activities can only happen with him in charge. Effectively relegating the whistleblowing activities to secondary importance behind Julian Assange himself.</p>

<p>Needless to say, both the Internet Party and the Wikileaks party have fared poorly in recent elections, despite all the advantages they’ve had. In September, the coalition of Internet Party/MANA alliance managed 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Party_and_Mana_Movement">only 1.42%</a> of the votes and lost MANA’s only seat , despite spending lavishly and with good news coverage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Wikileaks did even worse in the 2013 Australian Federal Election, having a high-point of 1.24% and even being the first-listed party couldn’t give any substantial boost to their electoral performance.</p>

<p>Of course, the (unstated) point of the Internet Party, and the Wikileaks party is not to win elections. Thus the losses were hardly surprising. They were attempts by the figureheads of the parties to exert political pressure, and to obtain free and easy publicity during a news-heavy period of time in their life. Any professed platforms are but shams, claims to tempt supporters with no substance or serious intent behind them.</p>

<p>How do we know this? Well, it’s quite simple. The setting up of a political party is time consuming, annoying and expensive (especially in the US), thus it’s not something you really want to do unless you have a strong political position that is currently unserved. In the US, Australia and New Zealand that political position is served, by Pirate Parties (since 2006 in the US, and 2009 for both Australia and New Zealand). While they don’t have the finances of Dotcom, or the media-hotline of Assange, they’ve worked steadily for a number of years on the exact same issues that both Assange and Dotcom profess to be working towards. And despite the lack of resources, they actually have produced some results.</p>

<p>Had Dotcom or Assange really been concerned by the issues, they would have worked with these parties. For the same resources they could have achieved much more, instead of working on the foundation they could have spent this time and energy on actual change instead. In addition, by setting up what are essentially clone parties, what they have done is split the vote making it even harder for either one to be elected and make real change.</p>

<p>In short, their actions show they’ll happily sell your digital rights out in order to get political leverage on their own personal legal
problems.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the US Pirate Party (as well as the Australian and New Zealand pirate parties) will continue to make slow and steady progress in elections. Continuously fighting the issues, on the basis of competence and hard work, rather than flashy events or a cult-of-personality. The issues we fight for are both too serious and bigger than the ego of any one man.</p>

  <p>The Pirate Party made a strong showing with its three candidates in yesterdays elections, showing the party has a growing base in the US that welcomes the forward-looking message of the party.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://masspirates.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_6085.jpg" />The 
<a href="https://masspirates.org/blog/2014/11/05/thank-you/">Massachusetts Pirate Party</a> had two strong candidates with 
<a href="http://votenoelani.org/">Noelani Kamelamela</a> and  
<a href="http://voteguertin.org/">Joseph Guertin</a> who polled better than most people expected. Guertin’s 4% in a 3-way battle, and Kamalamela’s 12% were both indicators that Massachusetts is ready for the Pirate Party.</p>

<p>The eight month effort of our two exciting campaigns has ended successfully,” said Massachusetts party Captain James O’Keefe. “While we are proud of Noelani &amp; Joe's election results, most importantly, we learned a great deal and identified volunteers and supporters who will bring us greater success in the years ahead.  Massachusetts politics will not be the same now that the Pirate Party is sailing in its waters.”</p>

<p>In Wisconsin, 
<a href="http://joeklein.org/">Joseph Klein</a> took on Democrat Jonathan Brostoff for the 19th district (on the waterfront in Milwaukee) and gathered an impressive 3,938 votes - 18% of the vote.</p>

<p>These are impressive results by any stretch of the imagination, but they’re incredibly good when you factor in the money-hungry election machine that most US elections operate under, as well as the preferential treatment given to the two main parties in laws nationwide.</p>

<p>The Pirate Party has few resources, and yet has managed to engage the voters with results that were above what was expected, while spending far less.</p>

<p>And in 2016 we’ll be in more places, with more candidates.</p>

  <p>On August 30th, the Pirate Party of Georgia held its Annual General Meeting, in the 5th Floor meeting area of the Atlanta Hilton. The event 
<a href="http://piratepartyofgeorgia.org/2014/07/the-pirate-party-of-georgia-invites-you-to-dragoncon/">was set</a> to coincide with the annual Dragon Con convention, where over 60,000 individuals would be present, allowing for greater exposure. Added to that, there is a 
<a href="http://eff.dragoncon.org/2014-schedule/">track of programming</a> that focuses on Pirate issues and topics, from CyberSecurty, to trademark and copyright law, and activism.
<!--more--> The meeting was opened at approximately 20:45 by state party Chairman, Jarod Smith, who welcomed all who attended, and recapped the previous year, expressing disappointment about the overall levels of activity. Questions were raised about the future viability of the party as an entity, both at the state and national level, and in the end, a decision to try for one more year before making a final decision was agreed to by all present. As it was the annual meeting, the positions of State Chair, and Vice-Chair were up for re-election. Both incumbents (Jarod Smith - Chair; Andrew Norton - Vice-Chair) ran unopposed and were re-elected for a further 1 year term with unanimous approval. The formal meeting was adjourned and an informal discussion session started, to work on rejuvenating the party, which was not minuted.</p>

  <p>We need Piracy on Beacon Hill, specifically, we need a Pirate to sponsor and promote bills on the hill that promote net neutrality, personal privacy, government transparency. Joe Guertin wants to be that representative.</p>

<p>Joe is young and energetic, but also civic minded and politically informed. And he needs your help. He’s not on the ballot yet, and we only have until April 29th to get all the signatures he needs. One Hundred and fifty signatures doesn’t sound like many, but to be sure to reach the goal, we’ll need something like 3 times that many people to jot down their John Hancocks, because so often a signature is invalidated for being illegible, attributed to the wrong address, given by a non-registered voter, etc.</p>

<p>Joe needs your help. You don’t have to live in the 8th Worcester district to volunteer. We need signature gatherers. If you believe in the Pirate Party and would like to see a Pirate on the ballot, if you believe in democracy and would like to see someone other than a heavily funded Democrat or Republican on the ballot, if you live within traveling distance of Bellingham, Uxbridge, Millville, or Blackstone, please consider volunteering for his campaign.</p>

<p>ABOUT JOE: He is a personal trainer by trade, a live-streamer because he loves it, and a trained game designer. He is 26 years old and lives at home in Bellingham, MA. He is taking on incumbent Kevin Kuros in the 8th Worcester District. I volunteered to chair his campaign because, like me, he is a media critic and is concerned about copyright vs. freedom of expression. The are two of the main issues that first brought me to the Massachusetts Pirate Party.</p>

<p>Volunteers should contact his campaign chair (Lucia Fiero) at sutralu@gmail.com.</p>

<p>Let’s do this.</p>

  <h2><a href="../../blog/Stop-Fast-Track-of-the-TPP/">Stop Fast Track of the TPP!</a> <span>Jan 29</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>In the few weeks prior to the President's State of the Union address, there has been a piece of legislation that would send the 
<a href="http://wikileaks.org/tpp/">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> into a "Fast Track," skipping the debate of the agreement by Congress and allowing the executive to decide whether or not the United States agrees to this deal with a simple majority vote of Congress.</p>

<p>If you have not yet heard about the TPP, it's not much of a surprise as it hasn't been covered often in national media. The deal has been one created in secret, with extremely limited public input. Very recently, Wikileaks released some information about the TPP, and from what little we can see of it, it will be devastating to the environment, jobs, even the internet.</p>

<p>We've teamed up with 
<a href="http://FightfortheFuture.org">Fight for the Future</a>, 
<a href="http://eff.org">EFF</a>, Reddit and other organizations to oppose the Fast Track of this agreement. If the TPP does get its speedy approval provided by Fast Track, ordinary citizens lose a voice to their elected officials about this especially controversial agreement. By voting for the Fast Track of TPP, our elected officials are depriving us of the voice given to us; we would lose a chance to weigh in on the agreement, throwing democracy into the trash to allow swift passage of trade agreements created in secret.</p>

<p>Today, we ask you to call in to your senators and elected officials to urge them not to vote for this legislation. If you'd like, there is a call-in app on 
<a href="www.StopFastTrack.com">www.StopFastTrack.com</a> that you can use to call your reps with. If you're on Twitter or Facebook, please share the page and call! If you do not wish to call, but still want to take action, you can 
<a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/stopfasttrack-email">send an email</a> to your representatives about Fast Track and the TPP.</p>

<p>For those calling or writing outside of the Stop Fast Track site, there is a script for you to use, and you can modify it however you please:</p>

<p>"I'm calling/writing to urge my representatives to oppose Fast Track for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Congress needs time to debate and amend trade agreements that affect all of us, and we the people need to have our voices heard about an agreement that has been created in secret. Fast Tracking the TPP is undemocratic, and I expect my lawmakers to oppose it. I'll be watching this issue closely in 2014."</p>

<p>This Friday, January 31, is the Day of Action. Around the country, there will be protests against this horrific agreement and preventing the passage of it. We'll post the locations later on today.</p>

<p>We've defeated SOPA and CISPA. The TPP is worse than both combined and effects everything we know and love. Let's fight against it, together.</p>

  <p>The State of the Union address is a required part of our country's government.&gt;He shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.</p>

<p>— Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution</p>

<p>In recent years, it's become less a statement to Congress, and more to the American people. As such it has become customary for opposition parties to give their own version. Rather than doing that, which might be considered usurping a power of the President, we'd rather focus on the content of the President's speech, emphasising what we feel is good, and pointing out what we think is bad.</p>

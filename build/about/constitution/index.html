<p>Constitution of the Pirate Party of the United States</p>

<p>PREAMBLE</p>

<p>We, the Pirates of the United States of America hereby unite in common purpose to promote open culture and oppose monopolies; to protect individual privacy; to put people before corporations; to support open and transparent government based on solid evidence and reasoning; to guarantee equality to all people; and to organize ourselves according to our shared values.</p>

<p>For our values, we have been derided as “pirates”. For our hope that every person may be free to access all of human knowledge, we have been called “pirates”. For our belief that one need not ask permission to participate in governance, industry, culture, and other aspects of society, we have been called “pirates”. For our insistence that citizens should not be surveilled and distrusted as if they are criminals, we have been called “pirates”. For our rejection of authority and profit-seeking when it does not serve the common good of all people, we have been called “pirates”.</p>

<p>We reclaim this label of “pirate” and abjure its derogatory, incendiary implication. We are Pirates. We stand for the liberty, equality, and solidarity of all human beings, and against all threats they may face.</p>

<p>We are Pirates, and we hereby establish the Pirate Party of the United States of America.</p>

<h2 id="article-i-pirate-party-of-the-united-states-of-america">ARTICLE I: Pirate Party of the United States of America</h2>

<h3 id="section-1-name">Section 1: Name</h3>

<p>This Constitution shall govern the association known as the <em>Pirate Party of the United States of America</em>, hereinafter referred to as the <em>Party</em>.</p>

<h3 id="section-2-mission">Section 2: Mission</h3>

<p>The Party shall:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Give voice to the Core Values of the Party.</li>
  <li>Adopt and promote statements of policy which implement these Core Values.</li>
  <li>Nominate and assist in the election of Pirate candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States, and support Party and Party-endorsed candidates for public office.</li>
  <li>Promote the growth of state and local Pirate Parties, and assist in their activities.</li>
  <li>Engage in any other activities incidental or related to the above.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="section-3-core-values">Section 3: Core Values</h3>
<p>We, the Pirates of the United States of America, form the Party on the basis of the following <em>Core Values</em>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We stand for open culture. No one should have the power to prevent the free exchange and expression of ideas, tools, or works.</li>
  <li>We stand for transparency and openness. Government activities should not be hidden from the public.</li>
  <li>We stand for individual privacy. The amount of oppression in a society is inversely proportional to its privacy protections. Individuals must be free to make personal decisions that do not harm another person.</li>
  <li>We are anti-monopoly. No monopoly should be able to prevent works, tools, or ideas from: being freely used, expressed, exchanged, recombined, or taught; nor to violate individual privacy or human rights. A creator's right to be compensated for their work or idea is only acceptable within these limitations.</li>
  <li>We stand for individuals over institutions. Universal human rights apply only to human beings, and not to corporations, limited liability organizations, or other group entities.</li>
  <li>We are a post-ideological values-based meritocracy. We place all options on the table. We choose a specific approach because the available evidence shows that it is the best way to promote our values. We do not make decisions based merely on tradition, popularity, authority or political expediency.</li>
  <li>We are egalitarian. We believe in equality and a level playing field. We accept input from all sources, and we value all people equally.</li>
  <li>We actively practice these values. We hold ourselves accountable for our own adherence to these principles.</li>
</ol>

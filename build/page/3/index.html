<p>UNITED STATES PIRATE PARTY CALLS FOR NETWORK NEUTRALITY IN RESPONSE TO COURT RULING</p>

<p>New York, NY - January 14, 2014 - The Pirate Party deplores the decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to strike down the Federal Communications Commission’s network neutrality regulations on wireline broadband services.</p>

<p>In its ruling against the FCC’s Open Internet Order (OIO), the court said "…consumers, of course, have options; they can go to another broadband provider if they want to reach particular edge providers, or if their connections to particular edge providers have been degraded," edge providers meaning companies and services like Amazon, Netflix, and Facebook. Citing Google Fiber's entrance into Internet sevice provider market as evidence that the market for ISPs is growing, the court failed to realize that Google's new service is only available in 3 metropolitan markets in the US, with minimal plans to expand service.</p>

<p>"The court's decision rests on the false assumption that US citizens can choose from a variety of Internet Service Providers in their area. The reality is that 42.9% of U.S. households have access to two or fewer wired ISPs," said Lindsay-Anne Brunner, Chairperson of the United States Pirate Party.</p>

<p>David Kay Johnston, noted tax policy reporter, points out that the telecom companies have been allowed to collect $500 billion over the last 20 years in order to bring American networks into the 21st century. Yet for most Americans, the telecom companies haven't delivered and US consumers pay four times what the French do, and for fewer services. The lack of competition in our telecom markets is the root cause of this discrepancy.</p>

<p>"AT&amp;T Wireless' plans to charge companies for the right to send video to their customers without chewing up their caps is what happens when telecos can ignore network neutrality. The court's decision will mean more profits for telecos and higher prices and worse quality for US residents," said James O'Keefe, Chairman of the Massachusetts Pirate Party.</p>

<p>We strongly urge Congress to rectify the lack of competition among ISPs and ensure that network neutrality is the law of the land.  If they fail to do so, the Pirate Party is prepared and eager to elect people who will.</p>

<p>The Pirate Party is only political party in the United States to make defending the Internet as an open resource for all one of its major objectives.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>As of the meeting of the National Committee on December 4th, 2013, nominations for the Board of the National Committee are now open.</p>

<p>As per our bylaws, anyone involved in a PNC Member-State Pirate Party is eligible for nomination. In the case that there is a nomination of a member who is not in a recognized State Party, one must be involved in Pirate politics.</p>

<p>Rules of nomination are as follows:</p>

<p>To nominate someone else, the nomination must be brought forth by a representative of a PNC Member-State Party. If one is nominated and does not wish to run, no action is required, but it is courtesy to decline the nomination. If one is nominated and does wish to run, one must accept the nomination formally over official USPP communication channels, such as the State Advisory Board mailing list and IRC channels.</p>

<p>To nominate oneself, one must announce the nomination formally over official USPP communication channels, such as the State Advisory Board mailing list and IRC channels. After the self-nomination has been announced, no less than two representatives of PNC Member-State Parties must second the nomination over the aforementioned communication channels.</p>

<p>At this time, 
<strong>no</strong>
 nominations or acceptance thereof will be accepted over social media websites, such as Facebook, Google+, or Twitter.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The deadline for nominations is the close of the National Committee meeting on 
<strong>December 12, 2013</strong>
. Any incomplete nomination, such as those that have not been accepted or seconded by the minimum number of representatives, will be deemed abandoned and those nominated will not be eligible to run.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Best of luck to all running!</p>

  <p>For Republicans in Congress I have this little tidbit to offer. Give it up, it’s not working.</p>

<p>The idea of shutting down the government to protect your principles seems like a nice idea, but it’s not working out for you. For a start, it actually goes against your principles, in that 
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24419564">it’s harming the economy</a> you profess to be protecting, but that’s neither here nor there is it?</p>

<p><a href=""></a></p>

<p>The reality in this case is fairly simple for even those with half a brain. You’ve not managed to get your way, and so you’re having a temper tantrum until you can. You’re hoping you can bamboozle enough people while this is going on, to keep your places in office come next year. Alas it’s not going to happen either, and let me tell you why.</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dMnWxJODstA/UlMShRUhOiI/AAAAAAAAAzQ/b6552YIxaUY/s1600/ingress+monticello.png"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dMnWxJODstA/UlMShRUhOiI/AAAAAAAAAzQ/b6552YIxaUY/s320/ingress+monticello.png" /></a></p>

<p>On October 3rd, I was out and about in the town of Monticello, Ga., hunting for 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingress_(game)">Ingress portals</a>. There are two by the US Post Office there (One for the 
<a href="http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM6WBX_Monticello_Georgia_31064">post office</a>, and one for the 
<a href="http://www.lat34north.com/historicmarkers/MarkerDetail.cfm?KeyID=079-5&amp;MarkerTitle=Site%20of%20Inn">historical sign</a> just outside it). As I was checking these out, and playing my game, a nice older lady approached me and asked if I was interested in knowing more about it, since I don’t look (or sound) like a local of the town. She explained about the mural that used to be inside, and was painted over (or put in storage, reports are mixed).</p>

<p>The kicker was when she asked me then what my thoughts were on the government shutdown. After saying I was disappointed with the House, and the childish mentality, she went on to tell me that she was disgusted, and was on her way to change from being a registered Republican (which she had been for decades) to an Independent. When I mentioned that the shutdown could have ended the day before, if Boehner hadn’t been insistent on the ‘
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastert_Rule">Hastert Rule</a>’ (showing that he’s not Speaker of the House, he’s Speaker of the Republican Party) and that there are enough House votes, both Republican (
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/01/house-republicans-clean-cr_n_4024755.html?1380659209">17 at the time, 22 now</a>) and Democrat to end this, she seemed scandalized.</p>

<p>That’s right GOP, your party’s actions scandalized one of your core demographics – little old white women in rural Southern towns. An area so southern and rural, that it seems to have become the stereotype, used in films from My Cousin Vinny, to Halloween, Friday the Thirteenth to Sweet Home Alabama, And The Fighting Temptations to the Cannonball Run.</p>

<p>This is what should not just worry the GOP, but PETRIFY them. That town helped elect Austin Scott in 2010, a tea-party GOPer; and in the redistricting became part of the 10th district under Paul Broun, another Republican known for his 
<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/georgia-senate-2014-broun-gingrey-kingston-nunn-97032.html">excess</a>. Both ran unopposed in 2012, but don’t expect that to continue (and Broun is campaigning for the Senate seat Saxby Chambliss is vacating next year in addition)</p>

<p>But when you act out of petty self-interest, ostensibly in opposition to a 
<a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/mar/20/romneycare-and-obamacare-can-you-tell-difference/">RIGHT wing health-care plan</a>, and seek to destroy the economy because of it, that’s when the little old ladies do what they do to their unruly grandsons; wash their mouths out with soap, give their butts a good whuppin’, and make them stand in time out until they remember their manners and their obligations.</p>

<p>And that’s going to be the 2014 story, despite the 
<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/gop-could-pay-price-for-gerrymandering-93597.html">gerrymandering</a> and election-rigging (be it 
<a href="http://falkvinge.net/2012/11/05/iowa-ohio-and-texas-take-stand-against-transparent-elections/">excluding independent auditors</a>, or through 
<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/28/republicans-admit-voter-id-laws-are-aimed-at-democratic-voters.html">voter suppression</a>). You have been warned.</p>

<p>At the same time, we’d like to point out that any Pirate elected to Congress certainly wouldn’t turn up 
<a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/10/01/grayson_blames_shutdown_on_gop_literally_drinking_on_the_job/">drunk</a>, try to 
<a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/gop-rep-confronts-park-service-ranger-at-wwii-memorial-you-ought-to-be-ashamed/">berate others for their own actions</a>, or otherwise act in a totally disgusting way. Indeed the Pirate Party would not have allowed this to happen at all. Not that you can vote for a Pirate in Georgia, because of the 
<a href="http://www.macon.com/2012/03/01/1926351/georgia-set-to-keep-harsh-ballot.html">highly restrictive ballot access laws</a> in this state – Anything so Republicans don’t have competition it seems.</p>

  <p>UNITED STATES PIRATE PARTY</p>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>

<p>Sunday, June 9, 2013</p>

<p><a href="https://uspirates.org">https://uspirates.org</a></p>

<p><strong>UNITED STATES PIRATE PARTY CONDEMNS GOVERNMENT SPYING; DEMANDS NSA DELIVER TRANSPARENCY, PHONE RECORDS</strong></p>

<p>In recent days, it has become known that the United States National Security Agency obtained a secret court order two months ago requiring the telecommunications company Verizon to hand over vast amounts of data. Under the order issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the NSA may collect data on calls that include Verizon subscribers; this data includes the phone numbers of those involved in the call, location data, and length. The court order does not provide for the collection of details on the contents of the conversations held by Verizon subscribers and their contacts.</p>

<p>The United States Pirate Party condemns the actions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and the NSA for infringing on the privacy of American citizens and peoples abroad. The USPP demands that future FISA court orders are reasonably limited and condemns the secretive operation of FISA, which should, when possible, make public information regarding requests for data relating to American Citizens.</p>

<p>"American citizens as well as individual members of the international community have been robbed of their privacies by the United States Government over the past two decades," says Captain Lindsay-Anne Brunner. "These issues that the mainstream press are suddenly talking about are in no way isolated, random instances, and should not be recognized as such. The American people need to put immense pressure on their legislators to enact laws preventing further gross violation of privacies by this government."</p>

<p>It has also come to light that the FBI and NSA have been indiscriminately mining user data from several websites run by US companies in a series of acts that violate the privacy of millions of people worldwide. This program, known publicly as PRISM, has been going on unchecked by the public eye, and the USPP demands this rampant violation of privacy stop. A government actively spying on its own citizens is unconscionable and not representative of the democratic nature of this country.</p>

<p>The United States Pirate Party calls upon Congress to investigate these crimes carefully and make use of the checks and balances that the Framers gave them by passing comprehensive legislation to stop the systematic practice of the United States Government spying on its own people. We ask that Congress help us re-affirm privacy as a human and constitutional right.</p>

      <p>Two weeks ago, the House Agriculture Committee<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150527/09320831127/even-before-tpp-ttip-us-already-being-forced-to-change-laws-trade-agreements.shtml">voted 38-6</a>to repeal country-of-origin-labeling. (COOL), and now it's the full House's turn. In a<a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll333.xml">300-131 vote</a>yesterday the "country of Origin Labeling Amendments Act" (<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr2393/text">HR 2393</a>) passed with the support of a significant number of Democrats as well as the majority of Republicans.</p>

<p>The bill's prompting and passage came after the World Trade Organisation ruled in favor of Canadian farmers, who sued claiming it was "discriminatory" and thus in violation of Free Trade Agreements. The problem? Cattle bought from abroad would have to be segregated from domestic cattle, increasing costs and making imports less desirable.</p>

<p>With Fast Track coming up for a vote – perhaps even today – it's curious to see<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/house-votes-repeal-country-origin-labeling-meat-31684167">this snippet in the Associated Press report</a>on the vote by the Speaker of the House:<!--more--></p>

<p>That is, of course, the same John Boehner that has been encouraging the President to get more support for Fast Track, in order to pass more of these "Free Trade" deals that impose more international bureaucrats and will almost certainly lead to more disputes that "require" Congress to "not sit idly by."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, remember<a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/05/read_obamas_speech_at_nike_ful.html">what President Obama said</a>at the Nike Plant just a few weeks ago:</p>

<p>Less than one month on, and we have exactly what he claimed 'is not true' happening. A trade agreement forcing a law change, and having what some would claim is an impact on food safety. And it's happening a day or so before the House is voting to create even more such situations whilethat it won't do this. Do they not even recognize what it is they're voting on?</p>
